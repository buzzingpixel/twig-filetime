# Twig fileTime function

Provides a `fileTime` function for Twig.

## Installation

When instantiating your Twig instance, add the FileTimeTwigExtension to Twig via the `addExtension()` method. Like so:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

use Twig\Environment;
use Twig\Loader\FilesystemLoader;
use buzzingpixel\twigfiletime\FileTimeTwigExtension;

$twig = new Environment(new FilesystemLoader('/path/to/templates'), [
    'debug' => true,
    'cache' => '/path/to/cache',
    'strict_variables' => true,
]);

$twig->addExtension(new FileTimeTwigExtension());
```
